                        The Java language has undergone several changes since 
                        JDK 1.0 as well as numerous additions of classes and 
                        packages to the standard library. Since J2SE 1.4, the evolution 
                        of the Java language has been governed by the Java Community Process 
                        (JCP), which uses Java Specification Requests (JSRs) to propose and 
                        specify additions and changes to the Java platform. The language is 
                        specified by the Java Language Specification (JLS); changes to the JLS 
                        are managed under JSR 901
